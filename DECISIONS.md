# DECISIONS

User-ratified decisions, newest first. Each entry mirrors an ADR in
`ARCHITECTURE.md` section 4, which holds the full context, options and
consequences. Where the two disagree, `ARCHITECTURE.md` is authoritative and the
disagreement is a defect to be fixed.

ADR-001 through ADR-015 were authored by the planner and live only in
`ARCHITECTURE.md`. This file starts at ADR-016, the point at which decisions began
being ratified by the user rather than proposed.

## M03 — OpenVINO conversion smoke test complete (b50e300)

**Recorded:** Sept 12, 2026 · **Closes:** ADR-014's first-48-hours requirement ·
**Feeds:** ADR-013 (export plan), M10, M13

M03 done Sept 12 (b50e300). Two findings for downstream modules:

**(1) NPU (NPU5010) rejects fully-dynamic batch destructively** — `STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION`
(exit `3221225477` / `0xC0000005`), not a catchable exception. **M13 export MUST use static
or bounded batch dimensions — a fully-open `-1` is unsupported and crashes the process.**
Diagnostic: the NPU compiler demands upper bounds on any dynamic dim —
`Upper bounds are not specified for node 'Multiply_11422' (type 'Convolution'): input '0'
bounds are '[9223372036854775807, 3, 224, 224]'` (`9223372036854775807` = `INT64_MAX`).
Static FP32 and FP16 both compiled and inferred correctly on NPU.

**(2) The conversion pipeline uses `openvino.convert_model` directly from live torch
modules — no ONNX intermediate.** The `torch.onnx.export` path was deliberately avoided:
it needs `onnx` and `onnxscript`, neither pinned. Fewer moving parts. **Do not assume ONNX
exists in the pipeline.**

Max absolute deviation vs the PyTorch FP32 reference: CPU `5.674362e-05`, GPU (Arc B390)
`7.408857e-05`, NPU `1.122952e-04`. Full evidence in `benchmarks/ov-smoke-notes.md`.

A third, procedural finding worth keeping: the first run accumulated results in memory and
wrote them once at the end, so the NPU crash destroyed the NPU *static* results that had
already passed. `scripts/ov_smoke.py` now runs each device/precision/shape check in its own
subprocess and writes immediately. Any future harness that probes a device which can crash
the process needs the same shape.

## ADR-023 (ratified Sept 12): Cut ACT training from critical path.

**Context.** Sept 12 is Day 2 of a schedule with five days left, and the plan is one
module behind. M03 — "a hard blocker for the whole OpenVINO story (20 rubric points)",
forced into the first 48 hours by ADR-014 — did not ship on Day 1 and is verifiably absent
(`scripts/` has no `ov_smoke.py`; `benchmarks/` has no `ov-smoke-notes.md`). Day 2 as
previously planned therefore carried M03 (3 h) plus M04–M08 (23 h) = **26 builder-hours in
one calendar day**, before the per-module tester → compliance-reviewer → tutor →
docs-writer passes that `PLAN.md` section 2 mandates. Day 1's own shape is the evidence for
what a day actually holds: M01 (2 h budgeted) + M02 (6 h budgeted) plus a correction pass
(ADR-016..ADR-022 and the opt-in rendering refactor) consumed the whole day.

Two further facts bind. ADR-020 means every simulation module runs on bm-ptl, and bm-ptl
expires Sept 17 00:15 (`CONSTRAINTS.md:5`), one day past the Sept 16 submission
(`CONSTRAINTS.md:4`) — so Day 6 is a working day, not a retry window. And ADR-022's
correction put M09's demonstration collection at ~456 ms/step, i.e. ~8.9 h of bm-ptl wall
clock for 70,000 attempted steps, which can only be spent overnight and only after M06,
M07 and M08 have all closed.

The arithmetic that follows is not close. M09b needs M06 + M07 + M08; at ~8
builder-hours/day those close Day 4 evening at the earliest; an overnight collection then
lands Day 5 morning, M11 trains Day 5, and GATE-1 could not be held before Day 5 night.
`PLAN.md`'s GATE-1 block already forbids sliding the gate even into Day 4.

**Options.**
- (a) **Keep ACT, slide GATE-1 to Day 5 night.** Leaves the OpenVINO benchmark, the
  bm-ptl pipeline run, the 10-seed recording, the documentation and the submission all
  stacked on Day 6, on hardware that expires that night. Directly contradicts
  `CONSTRAINTS.md:50-52`, which rewards a complete pipeline over half-working ML.
- (b) **Keep ACT, shrink the dataset to the pre-committed 4 h / ~31,500-attempted-step
  run.** This was `PLAN.md`'s own recommended degradation, and it is still the right
  degradation *within* the learned branch — but it saves ~5 h of unattended wall clock,
  not the ~18 builder-hours the schedule is actually short. It treats a capacity problem
  as a wall-clock problem.
- (c) **Cut ACT (M11) and its demonstration dataset (M09b) from the critical path, ship
  the scripted controller as the policy, and keep a much cheaper frame-collection module
  (M09a) to feed the PoseNet that ADR-009 put in the loop.**
- (d) **Cut PoseNet (M10) instead and keep ACT.** Puts the 20-point OpenVINO criterion
  back onto the riskiest module — exactly the dependency ADR-009 exists to break — and
  leaves `--perception state` in the demo loop against ADR-005.

**Decision.** (c). M11 and M09b move wholesale into F3 (optional revival after M18, under
F3's existing hard stop, and realistically unreachable). The scripted controller from M06
is the policy: F1 and F2 are activated now rather than being contingent on a GATE-1
verdict. GATE-1 is retained on Day 3 as `CONSTRAINTS.md:50-52` requires, but is decided on
**schedule evidence** and its outcome is pre-committed to the scripted branch.

Three sub-decisions ride with it and are recorded here because they are structural, not
scheduling detail:

1. **A planning capacity is fixed at 8 builder-hours/day**, module budgets stay denominated
   in builder-hours, and the day rather than the module absorbs the ~30% review overhead.
   This is an assumption derived from Day 1's shape, not a measurement, and it is the
   number to correct if the user knows their throughput differs.
2. **Clock gates replace judgement calls.** Every day boundary in `PLAN.md` section 1A.5
   carries a pre-committed time, and `PLAN.md` section 1A.6 is an ordered cut ladder whose
   rungs fire on a missed gate without re-litigation. The specific hole this closes: M09b's
   "if M08 does not close in time" had no definition of "in time", so the most
   consequential decision in the plan was left to a tired developer at night. It is now
   22:00 / 23:00 / abort, with a 07:00 hard stop, retained in force for F3.
3. **M09a's camera set is re-derived from its surviving consumer.** ADR-022 fixed M09's
   cameras at `['front', 'armA_wrist', 'armB_wrist']` *because that was M11's training
   set*. With M11 cut, the set follows M10's PoseNet input instead: `front` +
   `drawer_view`, because the drawer is occluded from every other camera (ADR-021) and
   `SceneBelief` carries drawer opening. Using the measured marginal camera cost of
   152.05 ms (`docs/hardware/m02-render-cost.md:43-49`) that is **~304.3 ms/step**, and
   ~5,000 frames is ~25 min of bm-ptl wall clock rather than ~9 h. **This does not
   supersede ADR-022** — ADR-022's Decision (opt-in rendering) and its ~456 ms/step figure
   are unchanged and return with ACT if F3 revives it.

**Consequences.**

*What this costs, stated first and without softening.* **No policy is trained.** Brief p2
objective 4 asks for a policy trained or fine-tuned with LeRobot or compatible tooling;
with M11 cut, nothing satisfies it. PoseNet is a trained model but it is a perception
network, not a policy, and it is not LeRobot. ADR-015 rule 2 already forbids calling the
shipped control path learned; this ADR adds the positive obligation — `PLAN.md` M18
done-when 5 — that the README *state* the gap rather than merely avoid misdescribing it,
and that it record that the branch was chosen on schedule grounds. "We chose scripted
because we ran out of days" and "we chose scripted because learning underperformed" are
different claims and only the first is true.

*Second cost.* M16 (full pipeline on bm-ptl) loses its day of slack: it folds into M14's
Day-6 bm-ptl session, on the last day the instance exists. The Day-5 20:00 gate — at least
one IR compiling on at least one device before Day 6 begins — is the only insurance left
against that, and it is thin.

*Third cost.* ADR-006 committed the evaluation harness to Day 2 specifically so that it
would exist before there was anything good to measure. M08 now spans a Day-3 evening
skeleton and Day 4. That is a real weakening of ADR-006 and is recorded as such rather
than presented as equivalent. The mitigating fact is narrow but genuine: with M11 cut there
is no second executor for the harness to be quietly shaped around, so the specific failure
ADR-006 insured against — a harness written after the numbers exist, to fit them — is
smaller.

*What survives, and why the cut is survivable.* ADR-009's whole purpose was to stop the
20-point OpenVINO criterion riding on ACT, and that argument now carries the submission:
PoseNet is converted, quantized, benchmarked across CPU/GPU/NPU, and executes on Intel
silicon on every control step of the demo. ADR-004 made M06 dual-purpose; with M11 gone it
is simply the policy. Brief p2 objectives 1 and 3 are answered by M06 + M07, objectives 2
and 5 by M05's grounder plus M10's OpenVINO-served perception. ADR-002's CommandSource
seam is untouched — M04 still ships the abstraction and a stub voice source even though
the Speechmatics implementation is unscheduled — and ADR-010's scripted `handoff`,
ADR-012's seed-derived randomization and ADR-018's true-success-rate reporting are all
unaffected.

*Honest bottom line.* Even after this cut the plan needs ~9–10 builder-hours/day for five
consecutive days against a capacity of ~8: roughly one day of negative float, recorded as
RISK-12. This ADR does not make the plan comfortable. It makes the plan's failure mode
"some scope was cut and said so" instead of "the pipeline was incomplete on Sept 16".

Ratified by user Sept 12. CONSTRAINTS.md fallback clause invoked
early on schedule evidence per compliance-reviewer's justification.
ADR-008's numeric gate becomes a formality; scripted controller is
the shipped policy.

## ADR-022 — Opt-in camera rendering in `TableSettingEnv`

**Ratified:** Sept 11, 2026 · **Evidence:** `docs/hardware/m02-render-cost.md`

Rendering all five cameras on every step cost ~810 ms; physics alone is 0.20 ms.
Measured on bm-ptl: state-only 0.20 ms/step, one camera 152.25, all five 809.86 —
a **4049x** spread. Confirmed real GPU time (`Intel(R) Arc(TM) B390 GPU`, OpenGL
4.6), and cameras scale linearly, so there is no fixed cost to amortise.

Rejected: keeping unconditional rendering (dominates step cost for callers that
never read an image); frame caching keyed on unchanged action (policy rollouts
change action every step, so it would never hit).

**Decision.** `cameras=None` by default — render nothing. `reset()` and `step()`
take a per-call `cameras=` override that does not mutate the instance default.
`render()` stays ungated as an explicit escape hatch. Names validate against the
model's discovered cameras, not a hardcoded list.

Per-module intent:
- **M09** collects **with cameras enabled** (`front`, `armA_wrist`, `armB_wrist`
  — ADR-005's vision path, and M11's exact training set). The scripted
  controller reads `get_state()` to *choose actions*; the camera frames are
  *logged into the dataset* for ACT. Cost **~456 ms/step** (0.20 ms physics +
  3 x 152.05 ms/camera).
- **M11** trains on those same three views; Kaggle reads pre-rendered frames and
  never invokes MuJoCo, so the render cost lands on M09.
- **M08** splits by executor: `--executor scripted` scores state-only
  (0.20 ms/step, physics only); `--executor learned` **requires** cameras at
  ~456 ms/step, because an ACT policy cannot produce an action from an obs dict
  with no images. Video capture uses all five cameras (~809.86 ms/step) **once**,
  on the final winning seed only.

**Correction, Sept 11, 2026 — Consequences only; the Decision above is
unchanged.** This entry previously said M09 collects with no cameras and that
M08 scores GATE-1 state-only. Both were wrong, from one root cause: ADR-005 was
read as governing *dataset contents* when it governs only *how the scripted
controller selects actions*. M11's policy is camera-conditioned, so a state-only
M09 yields a dataset ACT cannot train on; and state-only scoring of a learned
executor is not a cheaper measurement but an impossible one. The cost is carried
in `PLAN.md`: M09 collection moves to ~456 ms/step, and the learned half of
GATE-1 moves from seconds to ~76 min (10 seeds x 1000 steps). Full version
history in `ARCHITECTURE.md` ADR-022 Consequences. Note that
`docs/hardware/m02-render-cost.md:65-66` still repeats the superseded reading and
is not authoritative on this point.

## M02 — TableSettingEnv, view_scene.py, physics probe, front-camera fix (fulfills ADR-020, ADR-021)

**Recorded:** Sept 11, 2026 · **Module:** M02 (dual-SO-101 table scene v0) ·
**Relates to:** ADR-020 (sim runs on bm-ptl), ADR-021 (generator, not hand-edit)

Compliance-reviewer found M02 done-when criteria 1, 2 and 4 unmet (`src/bimanual/sim/env.py`
and `scripts/view_scene.py` did not exist yet). Closed in four separately committed steps,
each run and verified on bm-ptl per ADR-020 (mujoco cannot import on the laptop):

1. `src/bimanual/sim/env.py` — `TableSettingEnv` with `reset(seed)`, `step(action)`,
   `render(camera)`, `get_state()`, `close()`. Default scene path resolves via
   `Path(__file__).resolve().parent`, not the process cwd; verified importable and running
   from a cwd other than the repo root (`C:\Users\devcloud\import_check.py`, run from
   `C:\Users\devcloud`). Measured on bm-ptl (mujoco 3.2.7): `nq=48 nv=43 nu=12`, 4 cameras
   discovered from the model (`overhead`, `front`, `armA_wrist`, `armB_wrist`).
2. `scripts/view_scene.py` — `python scripts/view_scene.py --headless --save out/scene.png`
   writes a 1280x720 PNG (clamped to the scene's declared framebuffer) via `TableSettingEnv`.
3. `scripts/probe_physics_stability.py` — reset(seed=0), 1000 steps of zero action, checked
   for NaN and free-body tunneling at every step. **PASS**: no NaN, no free body dropped
   below `FLOOR_Z=0.30` m (5 cm below the 0.35 m tabletop surface — chosen so ordinary
   millimetre-scale contact settling cannot trip it; see
   `docs/hardware/m02-physics-stability.md` for the full derivation and the measured per-body
   minimum z values). Per the task's stop rule, this gated whether subtask (d) proceeded —
   it passed, so (d) went ahead.
4. Front-camera clipping fix. The camera used `mode="targetbody" target="table"`, which
   aims at the table body's own origin (z=0); measured on bm-ptl, the highest arm geometry
   at the reset pose reaches z≈0.667 against a 0.35 m tabletop, so the frame cropped both
   arms above the gripper. The camera is emitted by `scripts/gen_dual_scene.py`'s template
   string, not hand-typed into the generated XML, so per ADR-021's consequences the fix went
   into the generator (`FRONT_CAM_POS`/`FRONT_CAM_TARGET`/`look_at_xyaxes`, a stdlib-only
   look-at basis construction) and the scene was regenerated, not hand-patched. `git diff`
   on the regenerated XML shows only the one `<camera name="front".../>` line changed.
   Re-rendered `docs/images/m02-scene.png`; both arms fully visible on inspection. Overhead
   and wrist cameras were not touched (re-rendered for comparison; identical framing).
   `git diff --stat -- scenes/so101/` is empty throughout.

The package was installed editable on bm-ptl (`pip install -e .`) so `import bimanual` and
`from bimanual.sim.env import TableSettingEnv` resolve from any working directory, per the
task's tester-readiness requirement.

## ADR-021 — Dual-arm scene composed by scripted renaming, not MJCF `<include>`

**Recorded:** Sept 11, 2026 · **Module:** M02 (dual-SO-101 table scene)

`PLAN.md` M02 named two candidate ways to duplicate the unmodified SO-101 arm for the
bimanual scene: MJCF `<include>`, or hand-copying the body tree. MuJoCo requires every
body, joint, site and actuator name to be unique across the whole compiled model.

Tested empirically on bm-ptl before deciding, via `scripts/probe_include_namespace.py`
(mujoco 3.2.7): `<include>`-ing `scenes/so101/so101_new_calib.xml` twice does not fail on
a naming collision — it fails earlier, because MuJoCo's compiler refuses to include the
same file twice at all: `ValueError: XML Error: File 'scenes/so101/so101_new_calib.xml'
already included / Element 'include', line 4`. `<include>` has no prefix attribute, so
even a byte-identical second copy under a different filename would still collide on every
body/joint/site/actuator name. `<include>` is therefore not viable for arm duplication,
full stop — this is the deciding factor, established by measurement rather than by reading
the MJCF spec alone.

Hand-copying the ~120-line body tree twice by hand was rejected in favour of
`scripts/gen_dual_scene.py`: a stdlib-only (`xml.etree.ElementTree`, no `mujoco` import,
runs on the laptop despite ADR-020) script that parses the unmodified upstream
`so101_new_calib.xml`, deep-copies its body tree twice, prefixes every body/joint/site name
(`armA_`/`armB_`), repositions each copy, generates a matching renamed actuator pair, and
splices the result into a hand-authored table/drawer/props/cameras template. Mesh and
material definitions are declared once, shared by both arm copies, since geometry is not
per-instance data. The deciding factor over hand-copying: a script guarantees the two arm
copies stay byte-faithful to upstream and to each other, resynchronized by a single command
rather than by two independent manual edits with nothing to catch a missed rename — the same
transcription-drift failure mode ADR-016 already flagged for the single-arm case.

Layout: SO-ARM100 reach is approximately 0.30 m (stated assumption), so arm bases are
placed 0.50 m apart on the table's two long edges (0.25 m off centreline each), leaving a
roughly 0.10 m wide band at the table centre reachable by both arms, where the five props
sit. Full context, options and consequences in `ARCHITECTURE.md` ADR-021.

## M01 — RISK-07 resolved: `openvino-telemetry` pin unified to `2025.2`

**Recorded:** Sept 11, 2026 · **Closes:** RISK-07 · **Module:** M01 (repo scaffold and
pinned environments)

`PLAN.md` RISK-07 flagged a discrepancy: `scripts/requirements-bmptl.txt:3` pinned
`openvino-telemetry==2025.2` while `benchmarks/bmptl-environment.txt:3` recorded
`openvino-telemetry==2025.2.` with a trailing period.

Read both files directly during M01: as of commit `e5d74eb` (before this module's own
work began) both already read `openvino-telemetry==2025.2`, with no trailing period and
no other differences on that line. The trailing-period form was never a real,
installable pin — `pip index versions openvino-telemetry` lists PyPI releases as
`2025.2.0`, `2025.1.0`, `2025.0.1`, etc. (three-component versions only); `2025.2.` is
not one of them and is not valid PEP 440 syntax as a distinct release. `2025.2` is a
valid pin and resolves to `2025.2.0` under PEP 440's version-normalization rules (a
trailing implicit zero), so `2025.2` — not `2025.2.` — is the correct value, and it is
the one both files share.

No further edit to either file was needed; this entry exists because the done-when
criterion for M01 requires the resolution to be *recorded* here, not only present in the
files. `scripts/verify_env.py` (this module's other output) checks
`scripts/requirements-bmptl.txt` package-by-package against installed versions
whenever it is pointed at that file, so a future re-introduction of the mismatched
trailing-period form on either file would surface as a plain string mismatch against
whichever file is passed to `--requirements`, not as a silent drift.

## ADR-020 — Simulation runs on bm-ptl, not the laptop

**Ratified:** Sept 11, 2026 · **Closes:** RISK-11 · **Promotes:** RISK-03 to blocking

`mujoco.MjModel.from_xml_path` fails on the laptop with `OSError: [WinError 4551]` —
Windows Smart App Control blocks the unsigned `mujoco.dll`. Reproduced on `mujoco==3.13.0`
and `3.2.7`, so it is an OS policy issue, not an asset or package defect
(`scenes/so101/VERIFICATION.md`).

Options: (a) disable Smart App Control locally — one-way and a standing security
regression on the daily machine, **rejected**; (b) run simulation on bm-ptl — dev matches
the deployment target the brief requires, gains Arc B390 and 32 GB, costs an SSH iteration
tax, **chosen**; (c) add WSL2 — another environment to pin plus EGL quirks, **deferred**
but retained as the escape hatch.

**Decision.** The laptop is for code, git and the Speechmatics client. bm-ptl runs all
MuJoCo work.

The outstanding MuJoCo compile-check of the SO-101 asset moves to bm-ptl, as does M02's
rendered PNG and every sim module's iteration loop. Note the cost: with (a) rejected and
(c) unbuilt, **RISK-03 (offscreen rendering on bm-ptl) now has no fallback** and the M03
rendering probe becomes a blocking prerequisite. bm-ptl's Sept 17 00:15 expiry now bounds
simulation development, not just benchmarking, so work must stay pushed to git rather than
living on the instance.

## M02 prerequisite: SO-101 asset acquisition — adopted from TheRobotStudio/SO-ARM100 (fulfills ADR-016)

**Recorded:** Sept 11, 2026 · **Closes:** RISK-01 · **Fulfills:** ADR-016

Per the user-specified search order for this prerequisite, option (a) — the Intel Hack-a-thon Resources
bundle referenced by a button on the challenge platform page
(`docs/challenge/Screenshot 2026-09-11 132213.png`) — could not be reached: no URL for
it appears anywhere in the challenge-brief PDF (checked programmatically for link
annotations, none found) or elsewhere in this repository. Proceeded to option (b):
**TheRobotStudio/SO-ARM100**, `https://github.com/TheRobotStudio/SO-ARM100`, commit
`eecbe3e0a9ebb23e25ad7b2759b03884c6660903`, files under `Simulation/SO101/`. License
**Apache-2.0**, permissive and public-repo-compatible; text copied to
`scenes/so101/LICENSE`. Full provenance in `scenes/so101/PROVENANCE.md`.

Per ADR-016, the asset's shipped kinematics were taken unmodified. Actuated DoF per
arm, read from `so101_new_calib.xml`'s `<actuator>` block: **6** — `shoulder_pan`,
`shoulder_lift`, `elbow_flex`, `wrist_flex`, `wrist_roll`, `gripper`, all hinge joints
under `<position>` actuators. This closes RISK-02's remaining "what is the number"
question with a measurement; it feeds ARCHITECTURE.md section 1's contract table at
GATE-1 as ADR-016 specified.

`mujoco.MjModel.from_xml_path('scenes/so101/scene.xml')` could not be executed
successfully on this laptop: Windows Smart App Control (enforced, not evaluation
mode) blocks loading `mujoco.dll` because it is an unsigned binary with insufficient
Microsoft cloud reputation — confirmed via Windows Event Log
`Microsoft-Windows-CodeIntegrity/Operational` (Event ID 3077/3118) and
`Get-AuthenticodeSignature` reporting `NotSigned`. This reproduces identically on
`mujoco==3.13.0` and `mujoco==3.2.7`, so it is an OS policy issue, not an asset or
package defect. A plain-XML structural check (no MuJoCo) confirms the files are
well-formed, all 6 actuated joints and all 13 referenced mesh files are present and
resolvable. Full verbatim command/output and diagnosis in
`scenes/so101/VERIFICATION.md`. Flagged as a new, previously unlisted risk
(**RISK-11**, not yet added to `PLAN.md` — planner's file, not builder's to edit) for
the planner/user to decide: disable Smart App Control on this laptop, verify on
bm-ptl instead, or add WSL as a local dev path.

## ADR-019 — Speechmatics credentials via gitignored `.env`

**Ratified:** Sept 11, 2026 · **Closes:** RISK-04 (handling) · **Relates to:** ADR-002

The Speechmatics API key lives in `.env`, which is gitignored. Code reads it from the
environment as `SPEECHMATICS_API_KEY`, never from a literal. A committed `.env.example`
names the variable with an empty value so setup stays reproducible. A missing key fails
loudly at startup; it must not silently disable voice.

Verified at ratification: `.gitignore:23` ignores `.env`; the local `.env` is untracked;
no `.env`, `*.pem` or `.kaggle` path appears in git history. A credential scan runs before
the repo is flipped public on Sept 15.

---

## ADR-018 — 10-seed evaluation reports the true success rate

**Ratified:** Sept 11, 2026 · **Closes:** RISK-06 · **Strengthens:** ADR-015 rule 4

The 10 evaluation seeds are declared in the eval config before the run and are not
changed afterward to improve the result. The reported rate is successes over those 10.
Cherry-picking 10 successes from a larger pool is prohibited. Failure modes must be
shown and narrated in the video, not merely tabulated in the repo — if 7 of 10 succeed,
the video says 7 of 10 and shows what the other 3 did.

Re-running a seed after a code change is normal iteration. Swapping the seed set after
seeing results is not; the committed seed list makes the difference auditable.

## ADR-017 — `pour` is a tilt-and-position motion, with mandatory disclosure

**Ratified:** Sept 11, 2026 · **Closes:** RISK-08 · **Confirms:** ADR-011

Arm B holds the mug, arm A brings the bottle over it and achieves a tilt-and-hold pose
within a stated tolerance. Success is pose achievement. No fluid, particle or volume is
simulated.

The absence of fluid must be stated in `README.md` and spoken in the video narration —
not a caption, not a footnote, not repo-only prose, because the video reaches judges who
may never open the repo. Compliance-reviewer treats a missing statement as a defect.

## ADR-016 — SO-101 DoF is whatever the asset ships, unmodified

**Ratified:** Sept 11, 2026 · **Closes:** RISK-02 · **Feeds:** M01, M02, ADR-013

The adopted SO-101 asset's shipped DoF is authoritative. The kinematics are not edited to
suit our controller — no locked joints, no added DoF. IK, ACT action dimensions and
OpenVINO input shapes adapt to the asset instead. Builder reports the actual DoF in
M01/M02 and it is written into the `ARCHITECTURE.md` section 1 contract table then.

Scene composition — arm placement, table, objects, cameras — is ours. The arm model is not.
