# DECISIONS

User-ratified decisions, newest first. Each entry mirrors an ADR in
`ARCHITECTURE.md` section 4, which holds the full context, options and
consequences. Where the two disagree, `ARCHITECTURE.md` is authoritative and the
disagreement is a defect to be fixed.

ADR-001 through ADR-015 were authored by the planner and live only in
`ARCHITECTURE.md`. This file starts at ADR-016, the point at which decisions began
being ratified by the user rather than proposed.

## M01 — RISK-07 resolved: `openvino-telemetry` pin unified to `2025.2`

**Recorded:** Sept 11, 2026 · **Closes:** RISK-07 · **Module:** M01 (repo scaffold and
pinned environments)

`PLAN.md` RISK-07 flagged a discrepancy: `scripts/requirements-bmptl.txt:3` pinned
`openvino-telemetry==2025.2` while `benchmarks/bmptl-environment.txt:3` recorded
`openvino-telemetry==2025.2.` with a trailing period.

Read both files directly during M01: as of commit `e5d74eb` (before this module's own
work began) both already read `openvino-telemetry==2025.2`, with no trailing period and
no other differences on that line. The trailing-period form was never a real,
installable pin — `pip index versions openvino-telemetry` lists PyPI releases as
`2025.2.0`, `2025.1.0`, `2025.0.1`, etc. (three-component versions only); `2025.2.` is
not one of them and is not valid PEP 440 syntax as a distinct release. `2025.2` is a
valid pin and resolves to `2025.2.0` under PEP 440's version-normalization rules (a
trailing implicit zero), so `2025.2` — not `2025.2.` — is the correct value, and it is
the one both files share.

No further edit to either file was needed; this entry exists because the done-when
criterion for M01 requires the resolution to be *recorded* here, not only present in the
files. `scripts/verify_env.py` (this module's other output) checks
`scripts/requirements-bmptl.txt` package-by-package against installed versions
whenever it is pointed at that file, so a future re-introduction of the mismatched
trailing-period form on either file would surface as a plain string mismatch against
whichever file is passed to `--requirements`, not as a silent drift.

## ADR-020 — Simulation runs on bm-ptl, not the laptop

**Ratified:** Sept 11, 2026 · **Closes:** RISK-11 · **Promotes:** RISK-03 to blocking

`mujoco.MjModel.from_xml_path` fails on the laptop with `OSError: [WinError 4551]` —
Windows Smart App Control blocks the unsigned `mujoco.dll`. Reproduced on `mujoco==3.13.0`
and `3.2.7`, so it is an OS policy issue, not an asset or package defect
(`scenes/so101/VERIFICATION.md`).

Options: (a) disable Smart App Control locally — one-way and a standing security
regression on the daily machine, **rejected**; (b) run simulation on bm-ptl — dev matches
the deployment target the brief requires, gains Arc B390 and 32 GB, costs an SSH iteration
tax, **chosen**; (c) add WSL2 — another environment to pin plus EGL quirks, **deferred**
but retained as the escape hatch.

**Decision.** The laptop is for code, git and the Speechmatics client. bm-ptl runs all
MuJoCo work.

The outstanding MuJoCo compile-check of the SO-101 asset moves to bm-ptl, as does M02's
rendered PNG and every sim module's iteration loop. Note the cost: with (a) rejected and
(c) unbuilt, **RISK-03 (offscreen rendering on bm-ptl) now has no fallback** and the M03
rendering probe becomes a blocking prerequisite. bm-ptl's Sept 17 00:15 expiry now bounds
simulation development, not just benchmarking, so work must stay pushed to git rather than
living on the instance.

## M02 prerequisite: SO-101 asset acquisition — adopted from TheRobotStudio/SO-ARM100 (fulfills ADR-016)

**Recorded:** Sept 11, 2026 · **Closes:** RISK-01 · **Fulfills:** ADR-016

Per the user-specified search order for this prerequisite, option (a) — the Intel Hack-a-thon Resources
bundle referenced by a button on the challenge platform page
(`docs/challenge/Screenshot 2026-09-11 132213.png`) — could not be reached: no URL for
it appears anywhere in the challenge-brief PDF (checked programmatically for link
annotations, none found) or elsewhere in this repository. Proceeded to option (b):
**TheRobotStudio/SO-ARM100**, `https://github.com/TheRobotStudio/SO-ARM100`, commit
`eecbe3e0a9ebb23e25ad7b2759b03884c6660903`, files under `Simulation/SO101/`. License
**Apache-2.0**, permissive and public-repo-compatible; text copied to
`scenes/so101/LICENSE`. Full provenance in `scenes/so101/PROVENANCE.md`.

Per ADR-016, the asset's shipped kinematics were taken unmodified. Actuated DoF per
arm, read from `so101_new_calib.xml`'s `<actuator>` block: **6** — `shoulder_pan`,
`shoulder_lift`, `elbow_flex`, `wrist_flex`, `wrist_roll`, `gripper`, all hinge joints
under `<position>` actuators. This closes RISK-02's remaining "what is the number"
question with a measurement; it feeds ARCHITECTURE.md section 1's contract table at
GATE-1 as ADR-016 specified.

`mujoco.MjModel.from_xml_path('scenes/so101/scene.xml')` could not be executed
successfully on this laptop: Windows Smart App Control (enforced, not evaluation
mode) blocks loading `mujoco.dll` because it is an unsigned binary with insufficient
Microsoft cloud reputation — confirmed via Windows Event Log
`Microsoft-Windows-CodeIntegrity/Operational` (Event ID 3077/3118) and
`Get-AuthenticodeSignature` reporting `NotSigned`. This reproduces identically on
`mujoco==3.13.0` and `mujoco==3.2.7`, so it is an OS policy issue, not an asset or
package defect. A plain-XML structural check (no MuJoCo) confirms the files are
well-formed, all 6 actuated joints and all 13 referenced mesh files are present and
resolvable. Full verbatim command/output and diagnosis in
`scenes/so101/VERIFICATION.md`. Flagged as a new, previously unlisted risk
(**RISK-11**, not yet added to `PLAN.md` — planner's file, not builder's to edit) for
the planner/user to decide: disable Smart App Control on this laptop, verify on
bm-ptl instead, or add WSL as a local dev path.

## ADR-019 — Speechmatics credentials via gitignored `.env`

**Ratified:** Sept 11, 2026 · **Closes:** RISK-04 (handling) · **Relates to:** ADR-002

The Speechmatics API key lives in `.env`, which is gitignored. Code reads it from the
environment as `SPEECHMATICS_API_KEY`, never from a literal. A committed `.env.example`
names the variable with an empty value so setup stays reproducible. A missing key fails
loudly at startup; it must not silently disable voice.

Verified at ratification: `.gitignore:23` ignores `.env`; the local `.env` is untracked;
no `.env`, `*.pem` or `.kaggle` path appears in git history. A credential scan runs before
the repo is flipped public on Sept 15.

## ADR-018 — 10-seed evaluation reports the true success rate

**Ratified:** Sept 11, 2026 · **Closes:** RISK-06 · **Strengthens:** ADR-015 rule 4

The 10 evaluation seeds are declared in the eval config before the run and are not
changed afterward to improve the result. The reported rate is successes over those 10.
Cherry-picking 10 successes from a larger pool is prohibited. Failure modes must be
shown and narrated in the video, not merely tabulated in the repo — if 7 of 10 succeed,
the video says 7 of 10 and shows what the other 3 did.

Re-running a seed after a code change is normal iteration. Swapping the seed set after
seeing results is not; the committed seed list makes the difference auditable.

## ADR-017 — `pour` is a tilt-and-position motion, with mandatory disclosure

**Ratified:** Sept 11, 2026 · **Closes:** RISK-08 · **Confirms:** ADR-011

Arm B holds the mug, arm A brings the bottle over it and achieves a tilt-and-hold pose
within a stated tolerance. Success is pose achievement. No fluid, particle or volume is
simulated.

The absence of fluid must be stated in `README.md` and spoken in the video narration —
not a caption, not a footnote, not repo-only prose, because the video reaches judges who
may never open the repo. Compliance-reviewer treats a missing statement as a defect.

## ADR-016 — SO-101 DoF is whatever the asset ships, unmodified

**Ratified:** Sept 11, 2026 · **Closes:** RISK-02 · **Feeds:** M01, M02, ADR-013

The adopted SO-101 asset's shipped DoF is authoritative. The kinematics are not edited to
suit our controller — no locked joints, no added DoF. IK, ACT action dimensions and
OpenVINO input shapes adapt to the asset instead. Builder reports the actual DoF in
M01/M02 and it is written into the `ARCHITECTURE.md` section 1 contract table then.

Scene composition — arm placement, table, objects, cameras — is ours. The arm model is not.
